Building upon the information in Sheet 1, this sheet focuses on city-level sales data. It provides insights into the total quantities delivered, the total number of orders, and the total amount of orders delivered in each city of the selected states. This allows users to zoom in on specific cities and identify potential sales hotspots.

Sheet 3: Sales Timeline

The Sales Timeline graphically represents the sales trend between March 31, 2022, and June 29, 2022. Users can interact with the visualization to obtain information about sales on specific dates, allowing them to spot any noteworthy spikes or dips in sales during this period.

Visual Appeal and Interaction:

Different visualization types were used strategically to ensure the dashboard's visual appeal. While some data, such as detailed city-level information and product sizes, are presented in tables to maintain clarity, bar charts, and interactive features were employed to help viewers better understand sales trends and identify key insights.

Key Insights:

The dashboard offers valuable insights to viewers, enabling them to determine the top-selling products in specific regions of the country and the popularity of different product sizes. Additionally, users can explore order statuses, such as cancellations and unshipped orders, and identify potential areas for improvement in the order fulfillment process.

Overall, the Amazon Sales Analysis Dashboard provides a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for understanding and analyzing sales performance on Amazon during the specified period, assisting businesses in making informed decisions and optimizing their strategies for future success.
